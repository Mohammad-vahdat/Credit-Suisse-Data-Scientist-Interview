“Happiness is like a butterfly, the more you chase it, the more it will evade you, but if you notice the other things around you, it will gently come and sit on your shoulder.”- Henry David Thoreau

At the risk of contradicting Thoreau, today we are chasing happiness! How, you ask? 

Here is the data from Gallup’s annual world poll on happiness, combined with other features collected for different countries. In the next 60 minutes, you are asked to come up with meaningful questions and insights (including predictions) from the said data. We want to see what you make from the data and how you do that, in the given limited time. This is mostly an open-ended task and don’t hesitate to show off your ML skills. And you don’t have to stick with happiness scores, per se. Feel free to make assumptions and combine any other openly available datasets. You will not be evaluated on the number of lines of code or its readability, but on how you apply your analytical and coding skills to the task at hand. 

The data links are provided below. For all practical purposes, you may use “Life ladder” and “Happiness score” interchangeably.

Good luck!
